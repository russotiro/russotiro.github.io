title: Three-chord vamp
---
<p>This jam was loosely inspired by parts of a I-iii<sup>7</sup>-ii<sup>7</sup> chord progression that's found in two songs: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMlqKHdckZ8">Rumours</a> by Kings of Convenience and <a href="https://youtu.be/TpRQLk7be5A">Easy</a> by Commodores. Around 5 minutes in, I actually played some of the melody from Rumours.</p>
