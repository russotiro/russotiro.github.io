<h3 class="blog-header">Happy? Valentine's Day</h3>
<div id="date-line"><p class="blog-header">February 14, 2022 - 11:36 PM</p></div>
<p>Valentine's Day has always been a depressing holiday for me, but this year it's depressing for a different reason than in years past.</p>
<p>For the longest time, I never had a desire for a relationship. I think this was due to some combination of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>My then-ongoing struggle to accept my sexuality</li>
    <li>My options in high school being severely limited due to my sexuality</li>
    <li>Social anxiety and perfectionism that prevented me from taking risks that needed to be taken for self-improvement (still working on this one lol)</li>
    <li>I simply just didn't have a need for it</li>
    <li>Other factors beyond my awareness</li>
</ul>
<p>Each time Valentine's Day came around, I was sad not because I was single and wanted a relationship, but instead because I was jealous of how happy other people seemed to be in their relationships. I was <em>content</em> with being single and wasn't interested in dating, but I wasn't necessarily <em>happy</em> overall&mdash;I was dealing with unrelated mental health issues, for example. So, seeing other people be so aggressively happy about anything made me jealous and depressed, especially because I was fundamentally disinterested in the thing they were so happy about.</p>
<p>I think you know where this is going. Last year, &#8220;slowly, and then all at once,&#8221;<sup>1</sup> I began to want to start dating. I've been talking with people and going on dates for around four months now. I'm still single, but I'm more hopeful for my future than I think I've ever been, and I'm looking forward to my first relationship. So Valentine's Day still hurts this year, but it hurts for a different reason. Thankfully, it's a better reason.</p>
<p>A wise man once said, &#8220;I said I wasn't gonna do music that's Latin, but I didn't say I wasn't gonna do music that's hard.&#8221; To that I say: I said I was gonna start a blog, but I didn't say I wasn't gonna get personal.</p>

<p>This is my first blog post on my website. Thanks for reading!</p>
<p>Recently, I've really been enjoying this song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iQN672qtvY">Decimal</a> by Novo Amor. I like to try to associate songs with seasons, and this one feels very winter to me. Maybe that's just because I discovered it around this time last year, but there's a certain feeling it gives me that really reminds me of the snow-covered ground of the winter.</p>
<p>Did you know that Novo Amor means "new love" in Portuguese? I just found that out like half an hour ago.</p>
<p>You've reached the end of my first blog post. I don't have the patience or the need to write longer blog posts. I don't think you'd particularly want to read a blog post that's any longer than this anyway. See you soon!</p>
