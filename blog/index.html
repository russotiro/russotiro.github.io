<h3 class="blog-header">I had a really, really good month</h3>
<div id="date-line"><p class="blog-header">July 31, 2022 - 11:39 PM</p></div>
<p>There are about 20 minutes left in the month of July 2022. It was one of my favorite months of all the ones I've lived through so far on this planet.</p>
<p>Fourth of July weekend, I went to the Museum of Science with Hannah, Luke, and Jame. We slept over at Jame's house, where I had my first drink. Then I went to Dylan's beach house two nights in a row with Hannah and Luke, with Henry joining for the Fourth. We watched the fireworks from Dylan's boat.</p>
<p>The second weekend, I visited Lillian and Jack in Burlington, VT, and we were joined by Luke, his girlfiend Emily, and their friend Abby. I saw Jack's work, and we went biking on the causeway over Lake Champlain. I went thrifting with Lillian and Abby, and we all went to a bar at night.</p>
<p>The third weekend, Hannah came up and stayed overnight at my place in Medford. We made a cool tortellini dish for dinner, and then we saw the milk bottle in Seaport the next day. We met up with Dylan and Maggie Sunday night and had dinner at Buttermilk & Bourbon.</p>
<p>The fourth weekend, I went to Maggie's new house and swam with her, Hannah, and Dylan. Then, the next day, I had lunch with Ms. Stadelmann, Luke, and Maggie, which was a touching experience I honestly still haven't fully processed. Then, Hannah, Luke, and I met up with Jame in Seaport to go see GoldFish on a boat cruise, which was super fun, and then we went to that Mexican place afterwards. We slept over at the Renaissance and then parted ways the following afternoon.</p>
<p>This weekend, the final weekend of the month, was the annual Dyken Pond trip with all my high school friends. We went swimming, ate some good food, played Bang, and hung out just like the high school days. Everybody had a great time!</p>
<p>Also noteworthy: at the top of the month, I also switched to iPhone after around 8 years of using Android.</p>
<p>This whole month was additionally defined in part by my developing crush on [redacted]. Although it culminated in a rejection, it was my first rejection, so at least it was a learning experience. But I'm still sad. These emotions feel very special. All I can say is I really hope that I'll be able to share them with someone someday.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, did I mention I had my first drink??? That was an important moment. Overcoming anxiety, showing to myself that I will not follow my mother's footsteps.</p>
<p>It's 11:58. I'm going to go to bed. Thanks July 2022 for showing me how good life can get.</p>

<!-- <h3 class="blog-header">It's time for me to write my love letter to the music of Porter Robinson</h3>
<div id="date-line"><p class="blog-header">July 26, 2022 - 10:43 PM</p></div>
<p>I listened to a lot of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Monstercat">Monstercat</a> in middle school.</p>
<p>Then, in the summer of 2014, between 7th and 8th grade, I discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/porterrobinson">Porter Robinson</a>. The song Sea of Voices was so unlike anything I'd ever heard before. It tapped into a feeling of wonder and awe that I'd felt with some Monstercat songs, but free from the confines of the EDM music production formula. I liked Lionhearted too, but I wasn't so much sold on the other singles off his then-upcoming album <em>Worlds</em>: Sad Machine, and later Flicker. This, combined with the fact that I didn't feel like buying the album when it came out and instead opted to stream it for free on some sketchy website at like 64kbps, caused me to lose interest in Robinson's music for the time being.</p>
<p>But, in the fall, for whatever reason, I revisited the album and found myself falling in love with it. I remember songs like Hear the Bells and Years of War being favorites of mine. It was around this time that my entire grade went to a nature camp in New Hampshire for three days, and while the camp experience had its ups and downs, I still strongly associate that trip with this album. I associate the music with the unique sense of freedom and wonder that comes with being 13 years old and going on a trip with all your friends (without parents) for three days.</p>
<p>It was also around this time that I discovered M83 and slowly started branching away from electronic music towards genres like rock, indie, folk, and soul. I ended up abandoning Monstercat and even all the other electronic music I used to listen to, including Porter Robinson.</p>

<h3 class="blog-header">First post</h3>
<div id="date-line"><p class="blog-header">February 3, 2022 - 11:01 PM</p></div>
<p>This is my first blog post on my website. Thanks for reading!</p>
<p>Recently, I've really been enjoying this song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iQN672qtvY">Decimal</a> by Novo Amor. I like to try to associate songs with seasons, and this one feels very winter to me. Maybe that's just because I discovered it around this time last year, but there's a certain feeling it gives me that really reminds me of the snow-covered ground of the winter.</p>
<p>Did you know that Novo Amor means "new love" in Portuguese? I just found that out like half an hour ago.</p>
<p>You've reached the end of my first blog post. I don't have the patience or the need to write longer blog posts. I don't think you'd particularly want to read a blog post that's any longer than this anyway. See you soon!</p>
