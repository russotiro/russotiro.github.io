<p>This is my first blog post on my website. Thanks for reading!</p>
<p>Recently, I've really been enjoying this song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iQN672qtvY">Decimal</a> by Novo Amor. I like to try to associate songs with seasons, and this one feels very winter to me. Maybe that's just because I discovered it around this time last year, but there's a certain feeling it gives me that really reminds me of the snow-covered ground of the winter.</p>
<p>Did you know that Novo Amor means "new love" in Portuguese? I just found that out like half an hour ago.</p>
<p>You've reached the end of my first blog post. I don't have the patience or the need to write longer blog posts. I don't think you'd particularly want to read a blog post that's any longer than this anyway. See you soon!</p>
