    <p>Hello reader, I just wanted to give a little context for my choice this month, and share a couple of bonus pictures.</p>
    <p>It's March 10 as I'm writing this, which means that it's almost the end of winter, so I'm starting to reflect on the season. I'm honestly really pleased that we got a respectable amount of snowfall this year since the totals from the previous two winters were laughable. I'm recalling the &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2024_nor%27easter">snowstorm</a>&rdquo; from last year where we were forecast to receive a foot of snow, and we ended up with just a coating.</p>
    <p>Lots of snowfall meant that nice winter pictures were easier to take. It's hard to make the barren wasteland that is New England in the winter without any snow look pretty in a photograph. But yeah, I'm just glad to have some pretty winter pictures again after a few years.</p>
    <p>I was listening to the acoustic version of Family by Jordan Rakei when I chose the picture for the month. I feel like it fits the vibe pretty well for whatever reason.</p>

    <table class="sotm-table">

            <td><em>Family (Acoustic)</em></td>
            <td>2021</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>For the bonus pictures I want to share, I found a new place in the Fells called Boojum Rock. Weird name, but it's a really nice view of the city.</p>
